\section{Forecast post-processing}

\subsection{Probabilistic forecasts: extended logistic regression}


\subsubsection{Background}

The goal of this forecast post-processing is to obtain an estimate of the probability that a quantity will exceed a certain
threshold; for example, the probability that sea surface temperature will exceed the upper tercile
of historically observed values. Here, this probability is modeled as a function of the numerical model output
using a method known as extended logistic regression.

In basic logistic regression, the logistic function $\sigma$, defined as
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} = \frac{e^x}{1 + e^x}
\end{equation}
and some predictors $x$, usually derived from model output in the case of forecast post-processing,
are used to transform the predictors into the probability of exceeding the value $q$:
\begin{equation}
    p \{ y > q  \mid x \}= \sigma(f(x))
\end{equation}
Typically $f(x)$ is a simple linear function of the numerical model predictions,
such as
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
\end{equation}

Basic logistic regression is useful for determining the probability of
exceeding a single threshold. However, multiple thresholds are often of interest; for example,
it may be useful to simultaneously predict the probability of sea surface temperature being below
normal (in the lower tercile of historically observed values),
near normal (in the middle tercile), and above normal (in the upper tercile).
This would require fitting two or three separate logistic regression models,
and the sum of the three probabilities would not be constrained to be equal to one.

To solve this problem, \citet{Wilks2009} introduced extended logistic regression,
which extends the basic logistic regression model by incorporating
the threshold $q$ into the regression formula:
\begin{equation}
    p\{y > q \mid x\} = \sigma(f(x) + g(q))
\end{equation}
By including multiple thresholds in the model fitting,
a single model that can generalize to any threshold is obtained.
The thresholds used in model fitting are typically chosen to be several
quantiles of the observed values $y$.

To use extended logistic regression to post-process CEFI
seasonal forecasts, we use the numerical model ensemble mean
forecast as the main predictor:
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \overline{x}_{\textrm{ens}}
\end{equation}
And the raw quantile value in the extension function:
\begin{equation}
    g(q) = \beta_2 q
\end{equation}
Note that \citet{Wilks2009} used the square root of the raw quantile value in this function when predicting precipitation. Here we use
the raw value because variables such as temperature can be negative.

The extended logistic regression model used here can be written in matrix form as
\begin{equation}
    p \{y > q \mid \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{w} \} = \sigma(\mathbf{X w})
    \label{eqn:elr}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{X}$ is a $n_{\textrm{samples}} \times 3$ design matrix
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{X} = [1, \overline{x}_{\textrm{ens}}, q]
\end{equation}

and $ \mathbf{w} $ is a column vector of parameters:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{w} = [\beta_0; \beta_1; \beta_2]
\end{equation}

This form of extended logistic regression derives a probabilistic
forecast from only the numerical model ensemble mean; it does not incorporate other information,
such as the ensemble spread.
Other methods that do use the ensemble spread have been developed,
such as a modification of extended logistic regression \citep{Messner2014}
or a different method known as non-homogeneous Gaussian regression \citep{Gneiting2005}.
However, given the identical initial conditions across ensemble members
in the first version of the CEFI seasonal forecasts, the ensemble spread
may not provide reliable information about forecast uncertainty.
Furthermore, the homogeneous form of extended logistic regression
is simple and computationally efficient to implement.

\subsubsection{Maximum likelihood estimation}

The parameter vector $ \mathbf{w} $ is determined using maximum likelihood estimation,
primarily using the methodology and notation of \citet{Minka2001} and \citet{Pregibon1981}.
We start with a set of $n$ known outcomes $\mathbf{y}$, the $n \times m$ design matrix $\mathbf{X}$,
and the vector of $m$ parameters $\mathbf{w}$.

As shorthand, the predicted probability of a single event can be written as $p_i =  \sigma(\mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{w})$.
Then, the log-likelihood for all events in the training dataset is:
\begin{equation}
    l(\mathbf{w}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ y_i \ln(p_i) + (1 - y_i) \ln(1 - p_i) \right]
    \label{eqn:loglik}
\end{equation}

After some algebra, the first derivative of Equation \ref{eqn:loglik} with respect to a parameter
$\mathbf{w}_j$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial l(\mathbf{w})}{\partial\mathbf{w}_j} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{x}_{ij} (y_i - p_i)
\end{equation}
Equivalently, in matrix form, the gradient is
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{g} = \mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T} (\mathbf{y} - \sigma(\mathbf{X w}))
    \label{eqn:grad}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eqn:grad} would be sufficient to estimate the parameters using gradient descent.
However, for speed and reliability, we use the second-order Newton's method, which also requires
the Hessian matrix.
Noting that
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial{\sigma}}{\partial z} = \sigma(z) \left[1 - \sigma(z) \right]
\end{equation}
The Hessian can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \mathbf{H} &= -\mathbf{X}^\mathsf{T} \mathbf{V} \mathbf{X} \\
    v_{ii} &= \sigma(\mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{w}) (1 - \sigma(\mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{w})) \\
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eqn:hessian}
\end{equation}

Finally, Newton's method is used to update the parameters:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{w}_{\textrm{new}} = \mathbf{w}_{\textrm{old}} - \mathbf{H}^{-1} \mathbf{g}
    \label{eqn:newton}
\end{equation}
After which Equations \ref{eqn:grad} and \ref{eqn:hessian} are recalculated and the parameters
updated again with Equation \ref{eqn:newton}.
This iteration continues until the sum of the parameter change
$\mathbf{w}_{\textrm{new}} - \mathbf{w}_{\textrm{old}}$ is less than a small number ($10^{-5}$).
If the estimation has not converged after 50 iterations, or if the Hessian matrix
is unable to be inverted, the parameters are set to null values.

\subsubsection{Implementation}

The parameters for the extended logistic regression were
estimated using monthly mean surface temperature, surface salinity, and bottom temperature output
from the retrospective forecasts initialized between 1994 and 2022
and corresponding monthly means from the GLORYS reanalysis \citep{Jean-Michel2021} interpolated
onto the NWA12 model grid.
A different set of parameters was estimated for each of the three variables,
each combination of forecast initialization month and lead time, and each
point in the NWA12 model grid.
Five quantiles were used in the parameter estimation: $ [0.1, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.9]$.
After the parameters have been estimated,
they can be used to predict the probability of exceeding any value given the forecast ensemble mean
using Equation \ref{eqn:elr}.
